				<p>Before there is any discussion on the future of sustainability, there is one premise that must be undeniably accepted: Within our generation, humankind will experience the consequences of global warming.</p>
				<p>The science is sound.</p>
				<p>Nearly all climate scientists – 97 percent – agree that global warming is occurring and will continue to occur, and the question has now shifted from “How do we stop this?” to “How do we live with this?”</p>
				<p>“Thriving in a Hotter Los Angeles” is UCLA’s answer.</p>
				<p>The university has essentially taken a who’s who of people that did better than you in class and streamlined them into a team of talented researchers focused on “achieving 100 percent sustainability in energy, water and biodiversity by 2050” in Los Angeles.</p>
				<p>While the title is appropriately cinematic – given the city we live in – the project fits in perfectly with UCLA’s self-prescribed vision of itself as a revolutionary institution committed to social change.</p>
				<p>However, after reading through the various sections of the initiative’s flashy-looking website, and especially after perusing its “components” section, I came away with one notable criticism: I still have absolutely no clue what this future Los Angeles would look like.</p>
				<p>There’s a lot of fancy-sounding jargon and great ideas – yes, I would absolutely love to see the university “develop new materials, devices and large-scale products to efficiently capture and store ambient energy as electricity” – but we’re still in the dark about what exactly the future entails.</p>
				<p>So, fully acknowledging that I do not have a fancy title associated with my name (“world’s best son” doesn’t count, Mom), I have put together a small blueprint using existing green technology – and keeping in mind the spirit of the grand challenge – for what a completely sustainable Los Angeles would look like in 2050.</p>
